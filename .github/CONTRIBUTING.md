## üí¨ Discussion

We prefer all changes to the project to be discussed beforehand, either in an [issue](https://github.com/zobweyt/Discord.Net.Template/issues/new), or in a discussion in our [server](https://dsc.gg/zobweyt).

## üöÄ Guide

However, please conform to the following guidelines when possible:

### Step 1 ‚Äî Ensure up-to-date

Please ensure that the documentation is kept up-to-date with any changes made to the feature.

*This will help ensure that the project remains accessible and usable for all users.*

### Step 2 ‚Äî Format code

We attempt to conform to the [.NET Foundation's Coding Style](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/coding-guidelines/coding-style.md)

```sh
dotnet format
```

*As a general rule, follow the coding style already set in the file you are editing, or look at a similar file if you are adding a new one.*

### Step 3 ‚Äî Bump version

Increase the version numbers in any files to the new version that your changes would represent.

*The versioning scheme we use is [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/zobweyt/Discord.Net.Template/tags).*

## üì¶ Usage

To start, open a command prompt and follow these instructions:

### Step 1 ‚Äî Get the template

[Use](https://github.com/zobweyt/Discord.Net.Template/generate) this repository as a [template](https://docs.github.com/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), open it in your editor, and navigate to the startup project:

```sh
cd src/Template
```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Configure the environment

We are using the [options pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options) for typed access to groups of [related settings](./src/Template/Common/Options). You should configure the [`appsettings.json`](./src/Template/appsettings.json) file or manage [user secrets](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets) via [CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools):

```sh
dotnet user-secrets set <key> <value>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Pending database migrations are applied automatically [before startup](./src/Template/Program.cs#L49) and an informational [message](./src/Template/Extensions/HostExtensions.cs#L29) is logged.

### Step 3 ‚Äî Run the app

To run the bot, just execute the following command: 

```sh
dotnet watch
```

The initial setup is done. Enjoy using the template! üéâ

> [!WARNING]
> Instead of using the `dotnet run` in production, create a deployment using the `dotnet publish` command and [deploy](https://docs.discordnet.dev/guides/deployment/deployment) the output.

## üé® Customization

Here is what you can also do:
- [ ] Follow the TODO comments across the entire solution.
- [ ] Find and replace all occurrences of "template" to fit your app's name.
- [ ] Rewrite the [`README.md`](README.md) file to fit your needs.

> [!TIP]
> Take a look at the [discord-md-badge](https://github.com/gitlimes/discord-md-badge) project which is a customizable badge that shows your or a bot account status, or a server invite.

## üß™ Testing

This project utilizes the [xUnit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) framework for creating test cases. It also incorporates [Moq](https://github.com/moq/moq) for mocking objects and [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) to generate fake data.

To run all the [tests](./test), execute the following command from the root directory in your command prompt:

```sh
dotnet test
```
